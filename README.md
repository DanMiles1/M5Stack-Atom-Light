# :bulb: M5Stack Atom Matrix IoT Light

The [M5Stack Atom Matrix](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-atom/products/atom-matrix-esp32-development-kit) is a $10 development kit with an [ESP32 microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) and is capable of running [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).

The form factor and LED Matrix make creating an IoT Light :bulb: a great project to start out.

This code is adapted from the original source for [M5Stack Core on Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/lukasmaximus89/m5stack-micropython-simple-web-server-20a4c4) for use with M5Stack Atom Matrix.
